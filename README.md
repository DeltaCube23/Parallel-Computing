# Parallel-Computing
Implementation of various Parallel Computing algorithms using CUDA C++

To Compile : !nvcc <file_name.cu>

To Run : ./a.out

Hillis-Steele is an Inclusive scan that keeps reducing operations in power of 2. Blelloch Scan uses downsweep operation and I have commented all the functions clearly so that by changing a few things it can be used for most elementary operations.
